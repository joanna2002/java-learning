Instance Variables (non-static fields):
- their values are unique to each instance of a class (meaning to each object)

Class Variables (static fields):
- a variable tha belongs to the class itself, so all object share the same single copy
- it is declared with the static modifier

Local Variables:
- temporary variables used inside methods to do a certain task
- they are only created when the method runs, and deleted when the method ends

Parameters (inputs to methods)
- input values you give to a method when you call it
- they are declared inside parentheses of a method
- they are not fields of a class, they're only used inside the method

Rules of Java Variable Naming:
1. Case-sensitive â€“ Speed and speed are different.
2. Must start with a letter, $, or _ (but using $ or _ is not recommended).
3. Can include letters, digits, $, or _ after the first character.
4. No spaces allowed.
5. Cannot be a Java keyword (like int, class, while, etc.).

Best practices (conventions)
1. Start names with a lowercase letter
2. use camelCase for variables with multiple words (ex. currentSpeed)
3. for constants (static final variables), use all caps with underscores (ex. MAX_SPEED)
4. use meaningful names
